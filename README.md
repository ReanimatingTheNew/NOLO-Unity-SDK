# NOLOVR SDK For Unity
Use this SDK to develop Nolo compatible moblie VR/AR games with Unity.  

## Getting Started
For first time users, please see [Getting Started](./Docs/en_us/GetStarted.md) ([快速入门](./Docs/zh_cn/快速入门.md)).  

### Notes for developers
- It's important to add a double click system button for players to recenter themselves in the virtual world/reset camera angle.   
    e.g.\
    Gear VR: InputTracking.Recenter();  
    Cardboard: GvrViewer.Instance.Recenter();
- about application icon  
    It would be much appreciated if you could add a small nolo icon on your app icon, indicating support for nolo devices. Material is included in unitypackage.
